# Derivations of Machine Learning Algorithms

Purely mathematical derivations of some machine learning algorithms, this is a WIP, 
I plan to do this for almost all math intense ML and DL algorithms.

Written with LaTeX using the [Arxiv Template](https://github.com/kourgeorge/arxiv-style)

## Available Derivations

* [Linear Regression](https://github.com/junaidrahim/ml-derivations/blob/master/LinearRegression/linear-regression.pdf)
* [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/junaidrahim/ml-derivations/blob/master/LogisticRegression/logistic-regression.pdf)
